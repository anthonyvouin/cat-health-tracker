# Cat Health Tracker

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Cat Health Tracker** project!

### Overview

The Cat Health Tracker is a web application designed to help pet owners monitor and manage their cat's health data. This project leverages Next.js to create a user-friendly interface for tracking various health metrics, including weight, meals, vet appointments, and grooming sessions.

### Objective

The primary objective of this project is to create an accessible application that can be effectively used by everyone, including individuals with disabilities. Accessibility is not just a feature but a fundamental aspect of creating inclusive digital experiences. 

### Focus Areas

In this project, we focus on the following key areas:

1. **Semantic HTML**: Using appropriate HTML5 elements to ensure the document structure is clear and meaningful to all users.
2. **ARIA Roles and Properties**: Enhancing accessibility for assistive technologies by adding ARIA roles, properties, and labels.
3. **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensuring that all interactive elements are easily navigable using keyboard shortcuts and logical focus order.
4. **Screen Reader Compatibility**: Making sure that the application is fully compatible with screen readers and that all content is accessible and understandable.

### Why Accessibility?

Ensuring accessibility is crucial for creating a more inclusive web. By following best practices for accessibility, we make our applications usable for a broader audience, including those with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments. This approach not only helps users with disabilities but also improves the overall user experience for everyone.

### Exercises

This repository includes a series of exercises aimed at improving the accessibility of the Cat Health Tracker application. The exercises cover various aspects of accessibility, including:

1. **Improving Semantic HTML and Structure**
2. **Adding ARIA Roles and Properties**
3. **Enhancing Keyboard Navigation**
4. **Testing and Refining Accessibility**

These exercises will guide you through practical improvements and testing procedures to ensure the application meets high accessibility standards.

By completing these exercises, you will gain hands-on experience in applying accessibility principles to a real-world project, enhancing both your skills and the quality of your web applications.
